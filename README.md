  - Occasional Empty Weapons when joining a game (in pregame ?) 
  
  - Missile names sometimes dont get updated correctly (missed sync ?)

  - Broken assists, update to 16 player compatibility broke sth that prevents some assists to be given to any players despite
    valid over 30 damage
  
  - Picking up a super leads to a message that tells you "you picked up this ... super". That meesage appears in the language
    of the server and not of the client for some reason. reproducable reliably on DF.net
  
  - Impulse: all weapons have issues with lag but the impulse also has trouble with its correct position
    If player A fights player B with an Impulse and just fires in a ring around him there will sometimes be ghost shots that 
    hit player B. why does the server think its a hit ? does it have throuble with handling the player input and position ?
  
  - Creeper desync ...
  
  - Invisible Ships: Frequently in big Anarchies you will encounter invisible but hitbox posessing ships
    Looks like its a ship from a pilot that has completed its deathroll but not been respawned yet
    
  - Devastators: Devastators sometimes become reliably unreliable. then they explode as soon as they spawns without any
    user input or it swallows the userinput to detonate it on the server and keeps flying despite exploding on the client
